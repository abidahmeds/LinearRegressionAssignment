# Linear Regression Assignment - Bike Sharing Rental Data Analysis 
> Usecase is to understand the factors on which the demand for the shared bikes depends. Specifically to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The assignment is to know:
- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- How well those variables describe the bike demands
nBased on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the service provider firm has gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors.

## General Information
- This project is about building a Linear Regression model through analysis of multiple parameters affecting the bike sharing rental count and sales of a bike sharing company baed on 2 years [ 2018-2019] data of the sales and related independant parameters data gathered on those days such as environment factors and weather conditions and details such whether the rental ws registered pr casual rent , whether the day was a holiday or working day , which day etc.
- The background of the project is that it is a learning assignment for the Upgrad executive program course on ML/AI.  
- refer the dataset folder , to observe the 730 records data set about bike sharing rental details for each day from 01-01-2018 to 31-12-2019.


## Conclusions
- Inferences of the Exploratory Data analysis on the dataset.
- Model coeefficients and summary parameters of the final selected model. 
- Useful charts and plots for the analysis done.
